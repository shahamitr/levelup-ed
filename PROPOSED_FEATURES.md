# 🚀 LevelUp-Ed: Future Roadmap & Feature Proposals

Based on the current "Game + AI" architecture, here are 7 strategic features to elevate the platform:

## 1. ⚔️ Peer Battle Arena (Multiplayer)
*   **Concept**: Real-time coding duels.
*   **Mechanic**: Users with similar MMR (Matchmaking Rating) are paired to solve a DSA problem or debugging challenge.
*   **Tech**: WebSocket + Monaco Editor (Shared State).

## 2. 🎙️ AI Voice Interviewer ("The Oracle")
*   **Concept**: Upgrade the "Boss Fight" to be voice-first.
*   **Mechanic**: The AI asks verbal questions, user speaks the answer. AI analyzes tone, confidence, and correctness.
*   **Tech**: WebSpeech API or OpenAI Whisper implementation.

## 3. 🌳 Skill Dependency Graph (Tech Tree)
*   **Concept**: Visualize progress like a civilization tech-tree.
*   **Mechanic**: "You cannot learn React until you have unlocked ES6 Promises."
*   **Visuals**: D3.js or React Flow interactive graph.

## 4. 💻 Embedded IDE (VS Code in Browser)
*   **Concept**: Move beyond chat-based learning to actual coding.
*   **Mechanic**: Embed Monaco Editor. Users must write code to pass the "Module Test". AI evaluates the code output, not just the text.

## 5. 🏘️ Guilds & Community Hub
*   **Concept**: Social learning groups.
*   **Mechanic**: Users join "Guilds" (e.g., "The Rustaceans", "Python Snakes"). Guilds compete on a global leaderboard based on total XP gained by members.

## 6. 💼 "Verified Skill" Job Board
*   **Concept**: Monetization & Career logic.
*   **Mechanic**: Employers can post jobs that require specific "Badges" from the platform. "Only users with 'React Master' badge can apply."

## 7. 🌓 Accessibility & Theming Suite
*   **Concept**: Inclusive Design.
*   **Mechanic**: High Contrast Mode, Dyslexia-friendly fonts, and UI scaling. Plus, sell aesthetic "IDE Themes" for Gems.
