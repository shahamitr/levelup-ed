## 🌟 Introduction
**LevelUpED** transforms technical upskilling into a high-stakes RPG. Instead of boring quizzes, you face **AI Bosses** in voice-interactive interviews. The interface adapts to your subject (Chameleon UI), and the AI generates holographic diagrams on the fly to explain concepts.

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚔️ AI Boss Battles (Voice-Enabled)
- Face off against "The Architect" or "The CISO".
- **Voice Mode**: Speak your answers using the microphone.
- **Evaluation**: The Boss deals "Health Damage" if you are vague, and takes damage if you are precise.

### 🔮 Instant World Generator
- Want to learn something niche? Type it in (e.g., "Svelte", "Astrophysics").
- The AI generates a **full custom curriculum, boss persona, and visual theme** instantly.

### 🧬 Chameleon UI Engine
- The app fundamentally changes its visuals based on the topic:
  - **Web Dev**: Neo-Brutalism (Yellow/Black)
  - **Cybersecurity**: Matrix/Green (Terminal style)
  - **GenAI**: Glassmorphism/Orange (Futuristic)

### 📽️ Holographic Visualizer
- Ask the AI Mentor to explain a concept.
- It doesn't just write text; it projects a live **Mermaid.js Diagram** to visualize the flow.
